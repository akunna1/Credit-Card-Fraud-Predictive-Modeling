# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning 

## About

This project builds a machine learning model to detect credit card fraud using a Kaggle dataset. It applies data science techniques and logistic regression to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

## Dataset

* Source: [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
* Contains 284,807 transactions with 492 fraud cases ⚠️
* Features include PCA components (`V1` to `V28`), `Time`, and `Amount` 💡
* Target: `Class` (0 = legitimate, 1 = fraud) ✅❌

## Tools & Libraries

* Python
* numpy, pandas
* matplotlib, seaborn
* scikit-learn

## Key Steps

* Data exploration & visualization (histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps)
* Balancing classes by undersampling legitimate transactions
* Splitting data into training and test sets
* Training a logistic regression model
* Evaluating model performance with accuracy scores

## Results

* Training accuracy: \~94.2%
* Test accuracy: \~90.9%
